Considered to be the gold standard of information security certifications, CISSP has definitely gone through multiple iterations since I first heard about it a decade ago. Having recently taken and passed the CISSP 2021 Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) exam, here is my take on it and some [resources]() that may be helpful in your journey. 

## About the exam
---
 
The CISSP 2021 CAT exam tests a candidate on the following 8 domains:

1. Security and Risk Management
2. Asset Security
3. Security Architecture and Engineering
4. Communication and Network Security
5. Identity and Access Management
6. Security Assessment and Testing
7. Security Operations
8. Software Development Security

The official exam outline is available [here](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/Certification-Exam-Outline).  

It has been some time now that the CISSP exam switched from the traditional 6 hours 250 questions format to the new 3 hours 100-150 questions CAT exam format.

The CAT exam format felt like a good break from the traditional multiple-choice exam. One of the highlights of this format is that you cannot 'Mark' a question to review later or go back to a previously answered question, as the next question you see is based off of your response to the previous question (the 'Adaptive' part of CAT). This can be a blessing for some folks and not so much for others. More on this format from the horse's mouth is available [here](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/CISSP/CISSP-CAT).

The best resource for further information is the [official page](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) from (ISC)². 

## Exam preparation
---
I had studied on and off for CISSP over the last couple of years and recently decided to dedicate 2 months to seriously prepare for it. Here is rough breakout of that in four stages:

### **Stage 1 (2 months before the exam)**

Primary go-to resource for initial study was the [Official Study Guide (OSG) - 9th Edition](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/(ISC)2+CISSP+Certified+Information+Systems+Security+Professional+Official+Study+Guide,+9th+Edition-p-9781119786238) and the [video course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/prepare-for-the-certified-information-systems-security-professional-cissp-exam) on LinkedIn from Mike Chapple to complement the reading. Note that the videos are not a one-to-one mapping of the book but close enough.

Other video courses recommended in the community are Adam Gordon's [course](https://www.itpro.tv/courses/isc2/accelerated-cissp-2021/) on ITProTV and Kelly Handerhan's [course](https://www.cybrary.it/course/cissp/) on Cybrary, both updated for the 2021 version of the exam.

### **Stage 2 (1 month before the exam)**

Next logical step was to validate the knowledge retained by using the practice questions - one can never do enough of these. By the time I had to sit the exam, I think I had done over 4000 unique questions. 

I used questions from OSG 9th Edition and the Official Practice Tests - 3rd Edition for the initial round and will recommend registering these books online on Wiley's website (steps to register are mentioned in the book) to get access to the questions online. This will give you the ability to flag incorrect questions and re-take questions without the hassle of erasing answers on your book and not to forget that you are expected to take the exam on a PC, so it'll be a good time to get accustomed to that.

### **Stage 3 (3 weeks before the exam)**

In order to retain the concepts, I went over the CISSP Mind Map videos from Rob Witcher at Destination Certification and the CISSP playlist by Pete Zerger at Inside Cloud and Security on YouTube. They are invaluable sources and give you good pointers to help retain the concepts with mnemonics and other tricks.

### **Stage 4 (1 week before the exam)**

Thor Pedersen's hard questions came highly recommended to inculcate the "Manager mindset" needed to succeed in the exam. 50-60% is considered a good score on these tests - you can always score more on these but understanding the rationale behind the correct and incorrect answers on these is the key to succes son the real exam. 

On top of that, whenever you need a break from studying or a day before the exam, I would also recommend watching Larry Greenblatt's exam tips [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg2geVJuvs) and Kelly Handerhan's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A) on 'Why you will pass the CISSP'.

And finally, a common theme for me during this preparation was being active on Certifcation Station's [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/certstation). They are a great bunch of talented folks who run free CISSP bootcamps every so often, taught by Adam Gordon and the discussions in the CISSP channel proved helpful in cementing the concepts. 

## Exam experience
---
I went in to the testing center to take this exam which meant following the current COVID protocols - wearing a mask throughout the exam (brutal). Besides that it was the usual shenanigans you would expect - testing center validating your identity, etc.

Now to the questions on the exam. The first few questions were relatively easy and made me wonder if I was sitting the right exam. I believe that is part of the process to determine and adapt to the right level of difficulty, so take your time and make sure you answer these questions correctly - take at least 30 minutes to answer the first 20 odd questions. 

After a few questions the test started throwing rather challenging (out-of-the-course) questions that stumbled me and ended up choosing the best response without wasting a lot of time. Quite honestly I hoped they were part of the experimental questions (ISC)² asks during the exam and do not count towards your final score. Following that, there was a mix of easy-medium-hard questions that followed until I reached question 100, at which point the exam ended for me.

Finally, when the results sheet was printed (and after the test center administrator took their sweet time to review it) it was shared with me.

It said 'Congratulations!' - a moment to celebrate.

## Final Thoughts
---
Here are some departing thoughts.

### **Visualize your pass**

It is an underrated but powerful thing. I've heard stories where folks have written their name followed by CISSP, [First name Last name - CISSP], on the notepad provided during the exam for this purpose. Others have updated their CV/resume before sitting the exam with the CISSP written on it. Use what works best for you.  

### **Put your "manager" hat on**

You're likely to hear this more than you'd want to during your CISSP preparation and there is a reason why - it might be THE single factor deciding your success on this exam. Kelly Handerhan and Larry Greenbalt explain this the best in their respective videos tagged earlier.

### **Make your own study notes** 

They don't need to be fancy/pretty but need to be yours. Personally, I used OneNote to paste all the important links and screenshots of all the questions I had challenge understanding. 

It might feel overwhelming at first but if you break it down into smaller chunks, it is manageable. 

### **Passing the exam is step 1/3**

Yes, when you pass the exam you have only 'provisionally' passed the exam. Now, if you have the required experience to be called a CISSP, then step 2 is getting endorsed and step 3 is paying the Annual Maintenance Fee (AMF). If you are yet to acquire the minimum experience now, then you can apply to become an Associate of (ISC)². More details on this will be in the email from (ISC)² following your pass.

> Good luck on your CISSP journey. Cheers!!
